# engram

AI knowledge graph that learns across sessions. Builds a persistent, queryable graph from your codebase and accumulates knowledge as you work — patterns, decisions, conventions, domain concepts — so the next session starts where the last one left off.

Tree-sitter AST extraction, Louvain community detection, HDF5 storage, Obsidian vault integration, MCP server for AI editors. Single Rust binary.

## Install

```bash
cargo build --release
cargo build --release --features all          # all optional features
cargo build --release --features "lang-python,lang-go"  # specific languages
```

## Quick Start

```bash
engram run ./my-project
engram query "how does authentication work"
engram path "Client" "Database"
engram explain "AuthService"
```

## Output Structure

```
my-project/engram-out/
├── engram.h5            ← primary storage (HDF5, fast partial I/O)
├── graph.json           ← JSON compat
├── graph.html           ← interactive visualization (vis.js)
├── GRAPH_REPORT.md      ← analysis report
├── cache/               ← extraction cache
└── vault/               ← Obsidian opens HERE
    ├── .obsidian/
    ├── _KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md   ← compact knowledge summary (read this first)
    ├── _KNOWLEDGE_*.md       ← AI-accumulated knowledge
    ├── _INSIGHT_*.md         ← AI-discovered insights
    ├── _COMMUNITY_*.md       ← community overviews
    ├── AuthService.md        ← code node notes
    └── GRAPH_REPORT.md
```

Data files (`engram.h5`, `graph.json`, `graph.html`) stay in `engram-out/`. Obsidian vault lives in `engram-out/vault/` — no binary files visible in Obsidian.

## AI Knowledge Accumulation

AI agents accumulate knowledge across sessions using the vault as persistent storage. No database — `.md` files are the database.

### How It Works

```
Session 1: Claude analyzes code
  → discovers "Repository pattern for DB access"
  → writes vault/_KNOWLEDGE_Repository_Pattern.md (confidence: 60%)

Session 2: Claude reads _KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md at session start
  → knows about Repository pattern from session 1
  → discovers same pattern in another module
  → updates file: observations 2, confidence 68%

Session 10: pattern observed repeatedly
  → confidence 89%, 8 observations → established knowledge
```

### Setup

Add to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Engram Knowledge System

### Session start
1. Read `engram-out/vault/_KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md` — one file, compact summary
2. Read `engram-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` — project structure
3. Only read individual `_KNOWLEDGE_*.md` when you need details

### During work
"Would telling the next session this help?" → save it.
Write to `engram-out/vault/_KNOWLEDGE_<title>.md`.
If same file exists, increment observations and raise confidence.
Don't touch _KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md (auto-generated).

See KNOWLEDGE_SYSTEM.md for full rules.
```

### Knowledge Types

| Type | When to Save | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `architecture` | System structure discovered | "3-layer: API → Service → Repository" |
| `pattern` | Design pattern found | "Observer for event handling" |
| `decision` | Design choice with reasoning | "JWT for stateless microservices" |
| `convention` | Code convention discovered | "All errors wrapped in AppError" |
| `coupling` | Module dependency found | "auth changes require session changes" |
| `domain` | Business concept understood | "Trade states: pending → filled → cancelled" |
| `preference` | User working style | "Prefers functional style over OOP" |
| `bug_pattern` | Recurring bug type | "Off-by-one in pagination" |
| `tech_debt` | Improvement opportunity | "Legacy auth middleware needs rewrite" |
| `ops` | Deploy/infra knowledge | "Staging uses different DB credentials" |
| `performance` | Bottleneck found | "N+1 query in user listing endpoint" |
| `lesson` | Mistake learned from | "Don't mock the DB in integration tests" |

Any type not listed — invent one. AI decides what's worth saving.

### Confidence Growth

Repeated observations increase confidence asymptotically:

```
Obs 1: 0.60 → Obs 2: 0.68 → Obs 3: 0.74 → Obs 5: 0.83 → Obs 10: 0.93
```

### Token Optimization

Claude reads **one file** (`_KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md`, ~500 tokens) instead of all knowledge files (~6000+ tokens). Details are read on-demand.

## Storage

HDF5 is the default storage format via [rust-hdf5](https://crates.io/crates/rust-hdf5) (pure Rust, no C dependency).

| | HDF5 (default) | JSON (compat) |
|---|---|---|
| File | `engram.h5` | `graph.json` |
| 10K node load | ~5ms | ~100ms |
| Add 1 node | dataset append | full rewrite |
| Concurrent access | SWMR supported | no locking |
| File size (10K nodes) | ~1MB | ~5MB |
| Partial read | per-dataset | full parse |

Both are generated on every `engram run`. The system prefers `.h5` when available.

## Obsidian Integration

Vault lives at `engram-out/vault/` — clean, no binary files.

Features:
- YAML frontmatter with source_file, type, community, tags
- `[[wikilinks]]` between connected nodes
- `_COMMUNITY_*.md` with cohesion scores, Dataview queries, bridge nodes
- `.obsidian/graph.json` with community color groups
- Vault is the source of truth — edits sync back to graph

### Single Project

```bash
engram run ./my-project
# Open my-project/engram-out/vault/ in Obsidian
```

### Live Sync

```bash
engram watch ./my-project --vault ./my-project/engram-out/vault
# Code changes → auto-rebuild graph + vault
# Obsidian edits → sync back to graph
```

### Multi-Project Workspace

```bash
cd ~/codes
engram workspace init    # auto-detect git projects
```

```yaml
# engram-workspace.yaml
projects:
  - ./frontend
  - ./backend
  - ./shared-lib

output: ./engram-workspace
vault: ~/obsidian-vault/dev-knowledge
```

```bash
engram workspace run
```

**What workspace does:**
1. Builds each project's graph independently
2. Merges into unified graph (cross-project edges for shared names)
3. Runs community detection on merged graph
4. Exports unified vault to configured path
5. **Collects** `_KNOWLEDGE_*.md` from each project into unified vault (tagged with origin)
6. **Distributes** cross-project knowledge back to each project's `engram-out/vault/`

Result: Claude working on `frontend` can read knowledge discovered in `backend`.

### Workflow

```
Code → engram run → engram-out/
                      ├── engram.h5 (data)
                      └── vault/ (Obsidian)
                            ├── _KNOWLEDGE_INDEX.md ← Claude reads this
                            ├── _KNOWLEDGE_*.md     ← Claude writes these
                            └── *.md                ← code graph nodes

AI Editor → engram serve (MCP) → query, explain, learn, recall
                ↓
    vault/_KNOWLEDGE_*.md updated → next session reads → better context
```

## MCP Server

```bash
engram serve
```

|------|-------------|
| `query_graph` | BFS/DFS traversal from keyword-matching nodes |
| `get_node` | Fetch node details by label |
| `god_nodes` | List most-connected entities |
| `graph_stats` | Node/edge/community counts |
| `learn` | Store/reinforce knowledge (auto confidence growth) |
| `recall` | Query accumulated knowledge by keyword or type |
| `knowledge_context` | Compact knowledge summary for session start |
| `save_insight` | Link multiple nodes with a named pattern |
| `save_note` | Free-text memo with related nodes |
| `add_edge` | Add relationship between nodes |

### AI Editor Setup
